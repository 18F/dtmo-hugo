# Traveler's handbook

The handbook is meant to be a plain-lanugage guide to the most common tasks that travelers need to know how to perform (as well as number of the rare/weird ones).

It will include

- a guide to getting set up with the GTCC

- a guide to DTS.

It would also be a plain language guide/refresher for many common tasks such as

- how to book travel
- choosing hotels
- various DOD travel programs
- a single point of reference that can guide people to other resources or finding the right support if they get stuck
