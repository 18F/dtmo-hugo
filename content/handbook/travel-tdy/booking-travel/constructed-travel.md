# <this is a title> Constructed travel

<define the topic in lay terms> Constructed travel is when you'd prefer to use a different mode of transportation from what your Authorizing Official (AO) has authorized you to use. For example, your AO authorized you to use commercial air, but you'd prefer to drive your own car instead. 
  
### <critical timely info > You may need to fill out a Constructed Travel Worksheet first

You'll need to fill out a Constructed Travel Worksheet (CTW) in DTS _only if_ you plan to drive your personal vehicle 400 miles or more for a one-way trip.  If you're driving under 400 miles, you don't need to fill out the CTW. 

## <general overview of how to complete the task> How to get your constructed travel approved

1.  Create an authorization in DTS or open one you've already created. If you've already completed your trip, open your voucher instead of the authorization.

2. Complete the Constructed Travel Worksheet (CTW), which can be found in the `Other Auths and Pre Audits` screen. The CTW will help you figure out the estimated cost (or the "constructed cost") of your preferred mode of transportation to see how it compares to the cost of your authorized mode of transportation. Attach the completed CTW to your authorization (if you haven't traveled yet) or your voucher (if you've already traveled). Here are instructions:

- [How to complete a CTW for a voucher](https://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/cnsttvl/CT_Voucher_Instructions.pdf)  

3. The AO will consider your CTW and decide how to authorize your trip. The AO will either a) allow full reimbursement for your preferred transportation mode or b) allow you to take this transportation mode, but limit your reimbursement to the constructed cost of the approved transportation mode.

### <policy info> Policy info
The Joint Travel Regulations (JTR) allows you to use your selected transportation mode, but it also gives the AO the right to limit your transportation reimbursement if your choice is more expensive. Constructed travel lets the AO compare the true costs of the same trip using different modes of transportation. [JTR, Ch. 2, Par. 020210 Privately Owned Vehicles]
