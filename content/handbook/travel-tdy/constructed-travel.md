# <headline> Constructed Travel (using your own vehicle)

<why this page exists> Constructed travel is when you'd prefer to use your own car for official travel instead of what the Authorizing Official (AO) authorized you to use. For example, the AO authorized you to use commercial air, but you
want to drive your own car to get there instead.
  
<critical info> You must fill out a Constructed Travel voucher sheet first. (https://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/Docs/CT_Voucher_Instructions.pdf)
  
<policy info> The Joint Travel Regulations (JTR) allows you to use your selected transportation mode,
but it also gives the AO the right to limit your transportation reimbursement if your
choice is more expensive. Constructed travel lets the AO compare the true costs of the
same trip using different transportation modes.
