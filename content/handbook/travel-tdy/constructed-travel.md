# Using your own vehicle (Constructed Travel)

When you go on official travel, the Authorizing Official (AO) will authorize or direct you
to use a specific transportation mode (i.e., the directed transportation mode), but
sometimes youâ€™d rather travel using a different transportation mode (i.e., your selected
transportation mode). For example, the AO directed you to use commercial air, but you
want to drive your own car.

The Joint Travel Regulations (JTR) allows you to use your selected transportation mode,
but it also gives the AO the right to limit your transportation reimbursement if your
choice is more expensive. Constructed travel lets the AO compare the true costs of the
same trip using different transportation modes.
