# <title> Constructed Travel (using your own vehicle)

<define the topic in lay terms> Constructed travel is when you'd prefer to use a different mode of transportation from what your Authorizing Official (AO) has authorized you to use. For example, your AO authorized you to use commercial air, but you'd prefer to drive your own car instead.
  
<critical timely info> **In most cases, you'll need to fill out a [Constructed Travel worksheet first](https://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/Docs/CT_Voucher_Instructions.pdf). (One exception is if you're using your personal vehicle and the trip is 400 miles or less.) After filling out the worksheet, attach it to your DTS voucher in the Expenses module, and justify the Constructed Travel pre-audit by confirming that your CTW is attached.**

## <policy info> Policy info
The Joint Travel Regulations (JTR) allows you to use your selected transportation mode, but it also gives the AO the right to limit your transportation reimbursement if your choice is more expensive. Constructed travel lets the AO compare the true costs of the same trip using different transportation modes.
